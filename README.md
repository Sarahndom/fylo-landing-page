- **Responsive Typography and Spacing:** Using a combination of `rem` and percentage units to manage fluid text sizes and vertical rhythm across different breakpoints.
- **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** Leveraging variables defined in the `style-guide.md` to manage the dark color palette efficiently and ensure consistency.
- **Building a Testimonial Grid/Layout:** Structuring the testimonial cards using CSS Grid or Flexbox to maintain the intended alignment and card dimensions.
